# How it works

This library relies on the browser as much as possible to do the layout calculations.

## Requirements

There are a lot of ways you could write a window splitter, but the requirements drive the approach.

For my ideal window splitter I want the following:

- Support for pixel and percentage based constraints on the panels
- Performant resizing of page
- Ability to save the layout
- Ability to restore a layout at a different screen size
- Support for an arbitrary number of panels
- Support for nested splits
- Support for collapsible panels
- Support for persisting the layout to cookies (SSR)

For what is essentially a line, there is a lot to get right :)

## Approach

### Picking the Display Mode

With CSS we have a few options for how we could do the layout.

#### `display: block`

Here we would have no help from the browser on what size the panels should be.
We would have to do all the calculations ourselves.
So no a fit for this library.

#### `display: flex`

Here the browser starts to help us out.
With flex we can define the size of the panels using percentages.
This is a large improvement over `display: block` but it's still not enough.
If we want to be able to support pixel based constraints the library has to do a lot more work.

To make `flex` work with pixel based constraints we would have to:

1. Convert to pixels while resizing both the panels and the page
2. All the while we would need to calculate the mins/maxes of the panels
3. After resizing is done we would need to convert back to percentages

This is cumbersome and pretty error prone.
Conerting back to just a percentage makes it much harder to enforce pixel constraints both when resizing the page and when reloading at a different screen size.

#### `display: grid`

With `grid` we have actually have all we need to implement the library.
CSS Grids can define the min/max of a column in both percentage and pixels.

Since we can define the layout for the window splitter entirely in CSS we get the following benefits:

- The browser does the initial layout and calculations of all the sizes
- When the page resizes we don't have to do anything. The browser will handle the layout.
- The grid template also handles loading at different screen sizes well

The main downside to grid is that it's easier to create and "invalid" layouts that don't fill the area becuase of min/max constraints.
In a `flex` you can ganuntee the width of the group will be filled, at the cost of accuracy.

### Resizing Panels

The core of the resizing algorithm is built around applying small deltas to panels relative to their
the resize handles.

As much as possible we try to rely on the browser to do the layout.
During the initial layout we rely on CSS grid and a group might be
defined like this:

```css
grid-template-columns: minmax(100px, 1fr) 1px minmax(100px, 300px);
```

Once the user starts resizing we start a 3 step process to update the layout.

1. `prepareItems` - The size of the group has been measure and we
   can convert all the panel sizes into pixels. Converting into pixels
   makes doing the math for the updates easier.

    ```css
    grid-template-columns: 500px 1px 300px;
    ```

2. `updateLayout` - This is where the actual updates are applied.
   This is where the user's drag interactions are applied. We also
   use this to collapse/expand panels by simulating a drag interaction.

    ```css
    grid-template-columns: 490px 1px 310px;
    ```

3. `commitLayout` - Once the updates have been applied we convert the
   updated sizes back into a format that allows for the benefits mentioned above.

    ```css
    grid-template-columns: minmax(100px, min(calc(0.06117 * (100% - 1px)), 100%)) 1px minmax(100px, min(calc(0.0387 * (100% - 1px)), 300px));
    ```
