# Imperative API

All components also come with an imperative API.
Each component has a `handle` prop that you can use to access the component's API.

> NOTE: `ref` is used to get the element for the component, so the imperative API is not available on the `ref` prop.

## PanelGroup

The `PanelGroup` component has methods for getting the sizes of the panels and setting the sizes of the panels.
